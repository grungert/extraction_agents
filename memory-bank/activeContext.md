# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps.

## Current Focus
- Continuing refactoring to make the Excel Extraction Pipeline production-ready.
- Focusing on implementing custom exception types and improving code quality.

## Recent Changes
- Refactored text preparation logic for dynamic agents, including creating `prepare_text_for_llm` in `src/utils/formatting.py`.
- Updated `DynamicClassificationAgent` and `DynamicClassificationValidationAgent` to use the new formatting function.
- Removed unused helper functions from `src/extraction/dynamic_agents.py`.
- Resolved the `ImportError` in `run_pipeline.py` by confirming the correct import path for `DynamicAgentPipelineCoordinator`.
- Initialized and populated core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Updated memory bank and `README.md` to reflect the addition of classification and classification validation steps.
- Enhanced Configuration Management:
    - Defined Pydantic models for dynamic extraction configuration (`src/models.py`).
    - Updated `ConfigurationManager` to use Pydantic for loading and validation (`src/config_manager.py`).
    - Separated application-level configuration (`AppConfig`) loading to use a dedicated file, and updated `run_pipeline.py` and `api_main.py` to load it at startup.
- Improved Error Handling and Logging:
    - Introduced Python's `logging` module and configured it with `RichHandler` (`src/utils/display.py`).
    - Replaced direct `console.print` calls with `logger.error` and `logger.warning` in `run_pipeline.py` and `api_main.py`.
    - Updated agents in `src/extraction/dynamic_agents.py` to use dot notation for accessing configuration.
- Initiated Comprehensive Testing Suite (postponed for now):
    - Created a `tests` directory and initial test files (now removed).
    - Removed the `tests/` directory and `pytest.ini` file to simplify focus.
- **Implemented Custom Exception Types:** Defined custom exception classes in `src/exceptions.py` and started replacing generic exceptions in `src/config_manager.py`, `src/extraction/excel.py`, and `src/extraction/dynamic_agents.py`.
- **Added LLM Token Logging:** Integrated token counting and logging for LLM input and output within the dynamic agents (`src/extraction/dynamic_agents.py`).

## Next Steps
- Continue replacing generic exceptions with custom types throughout the codebase.
- Analyze and optimize pipeline performance.
- Continue code quality improvements (add/improve type hints, docstrings, refactor complex logic).
- Enhance overall project documentation.
- Review security considerations.
- Define a deployment strategy.
- Conduct a systematic review for full dynamism.
- Revisit and improve the test suite later.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The core application is now runnable.
- Custom exceptions are being implemented for better error handling.
- LLM token usage is being logged for observability.
- Test development is postponed to focus on core refactoring.
