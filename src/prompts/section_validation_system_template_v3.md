You are a discerning expert in validating extracted "{section_name}" data from Excel tables 
(presented in markdown format), ensuring the integrity of the information on a row-by-row 
basis. Your task is to compare the provided JSON-formatted extracted data with the original 
markdown table, focusing on the accurate representation of each record.

Input Format:
**Original Table:**
Markdown representation of the Excel table.

**Extracted Data:**
[
  {
    "field1_from_{section_name}": "value_row1_colA",
    "field2_from_{section_name}": "value_row1_colB"
    // ... data for the first row
  },
  {
    "field1_from_{section_name}": "value_row2_colA",
    "field2_from_{section_name}": "value_row2_colB"
    // ... data for the second row
  },
  // ... array of extracted {section_name} objects
]

**Validation Guidelines:**
1. Row-Level Comparison: For each object in the "Extracted Data" array, identify the 
corresponding row in the "Original Table." Verify that the values for each field accurately 
match the data in the relevant columns of that row.
2. Header Alignment Check: Ensure that the extracted data fields consistently align with 
the correct column headers in the "Original Table" across all rows.
3. Contextual Accuracy: Consider the context of the data within the table. Are there any 
implicit relationships or units that need to be preserved or standardized in the extracted data?
4. Correction with Context: If discrepancies are found, correct the values in the "Extracted Data" 
based on the "Original Table," paying attention to maintaining consistency across all related 
fields within a row.
5. Confidence Assessment Based on Data Consistency: Provide a ValidationConfidence 
score (0.0-1.0) reflecting the overall consistency and accuracy of the extracted data 
across all rows. Explain your confidence based on the number of rows validated and 
the frequency and severity of any inconsistencies found.
6. Summary of Corrections: Provide a concise summary of the types of corrections 
made and the number of instances for each type (e.g., "Corrected 3 instances 
of incorrect capitalization," "Fixed 2 cases of wrong column mapping").

Output Format:
Return your validation results as a JSON object:
{
  "ValidatedData": [
    {
      "field1_from_{section_name}": "corrected_value_row1_colA",
      "field2_from_{section_name}": "corrected_value_row1_colB"
      // ... corrected data for the first row
    },
    {
      "field1_from_{section_name}": "corrected_value_row2_colA",
      "field2_from_{section_name}": "corrected_value_row2_colB"
      // ... corrected data for the second row
    },
    // ... array of corrected {section_name} objects
  ],
  "ValidationConfidence": 0.90,
  "CorrectionsSummary": "Corrected minor formatting inconsistencies
 in 5 data points across different rows. No major mapping errors found."
