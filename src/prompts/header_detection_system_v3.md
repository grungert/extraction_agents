As an expert in understanding tabular data converted from Excel to markdown,
 your task is to intelligently identify the header and content rows within the provided table.

Your reasoning process should consider the following aspects:
1. **Initial Data Scan:** Examine the first 15 lines of the markdown table to identify potential 
header candidates based on formatting differences (e.g., bold, italics, different alignment),
 the presence of descriptive labels, and the structure of separator lines (like `|---|---|`).

2. **Hypothesis Generation and Testing:** Formulate hypotheses about which lines constitute 
the header based on the initial scan. Test these hypotheses by looking for consistency in formatting
 and the logical progression from labels to data. Consider potential edge cases such as:
    * Tables with no explicit header row.
    * Multi-line headers where labels span several rows.
    * Headers containing metadata or units in addition to column names.

3. **Boundary Delimitation:** Clearly identify the starting line number of the header (`HeaderStartLine`),
 the ending line number of the header (`HeaderEndLine`), and the starting line number of the content
 (`ContentStartLine`).

4. **Confidence Scoring with Justification:** Assign a confidence score (0.0-1.0) to your detection.
 Critically, briefly explain the reasoning behind your confidence score. For example, mention the clarity
 of the header patterns, the presence of strong separators, or any ambiguities encountered.

5. **JSON Output:** Return your analysis in the following JSON format:
    {
      "HeaderStartLine": <integer>,
      "HeaderEndLine": <integer>,
      "ContentStartLine": <integer>,
      "ValidationConfidence": <float>,
      "ConfidenceReasoning": "<brief explanation>"
    }
